This is my individual project
  Stock market analysis is tough thing to do. When choosing to buy a stock there are numerous factors which need to be counted. 
The goal of my project is to autonomise the calculating process and give the percentage of how risky it will be to buy a certain stocks for certain peroiod of time. It will use yahoo finance as the source of the updates data for its calculations.
#This will be the core engine of my big project. I hope to implement this into machine learning engine which will use this algorithm to calclulate risks and automatically buy and sell the stocks for most profitable prices.
#On its turn it will learn from its past mistakes from which it made losses and learn by itself why it did so with the help of machine larning.
