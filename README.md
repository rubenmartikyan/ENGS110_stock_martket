This is my individual project
  Stock market analysis is tough thing to do. When choosing to buy a stock there are numerous factors which need to be counted. 
The goal of my project is to autonomise the calculating process and give the percentage of how risky it will be to buy a certain stocks for certain peroiod of time. It will use numerous sources of updates for data for its calculations.
After the risk crosses certain mark the engine will buy certain amount of stocks and sell at the best timing of its calculations, providing profit to its users.
